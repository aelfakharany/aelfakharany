## 👋 Welcome! I'm Ahmad.
- 🌱 I'm working on leveling up my full-stack chops, learning technologies like Next.js, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.
- 🛠️ Currently building a full-stack application to solve a pressing problem on my college campus (stay tuned!), as well as various C++ programs with an emphasis on efficiency.
- 🤝 I'm open to working on cool projects.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at ahmadel@umich.edu
